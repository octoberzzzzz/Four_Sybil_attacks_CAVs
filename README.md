# Four_Sybil_attacks_CAVs

The dataset was generated using the F2MD simulation framework and includes four types of Sybil attacks, referencing the VeReMi-Extension dataset. Preprocessing was conducted, with the 
$nttack$ label indicating the occurrence of a Sybil attack, based on F2MD and VeReMi-Extension. The $node_attack$ label differentiates between real attacker nodes and Sybil nodes, determined by the specific type of Sybil attack. The simulation time for this dataset ranges from 28860 to 28920 seconds, corresponding to 8 hours and 1 minute to 8 hours and 2 minutes. The geographic scope of the data was no longer 1500m*1500m, but 400*1500.
